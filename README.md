# CheatlessTweaks `v1.0.0`
* Simply allows you to change the `mobGriefing` and `playersSleepingPercentage` gamerules without turning on cheats and without disabling achievements.
* You must make the changes with the `/gamerule` command, as there is no GUI option yet.
* More gamerules can be added if there is enough demand. Just make an issue if you have a gamerule you think should be added.
