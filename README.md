# CheatlessTweaks `v1.1.0`
* **Huge** thanks to Freddie for basically holding my hand while making this mod, and teaching me RE along the way.
* Supports Minecraft version `1.21.0.3` using AmethystRuntime `v1.3.1`
* Simply allows you to change the `mobGriefing`, `playersSleepingPercentage`, and `doWeatherCycle` gamerules without turning on cheats and without disabling achievements.
* You must make the changes with the `/gamerule` command, as there is no GUI option yet.
* You still have to be an operator to use the command
* More gamerules can be added if there is enough demand. Just make an issue if you have a gamerule you think should be added.
